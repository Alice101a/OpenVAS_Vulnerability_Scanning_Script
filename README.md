# OpenVAS_Vulnerability_Scanning_Script
The Python script is a flexible OpenVAS vulnerability scanner that connects to an OpenVAS Manager and performs vulnerability scans on a specified target host. It uses the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) library to interact with the OpenVAS Manager and retrieve scan results. The script provides command-line options to customize the scan, including specifying the OpenVAS Manager credentials, target host IP, and the OpenVAS scan configuration ID.

Features:

Modular Functions: The script is organized into modular functions, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Error Handling: The script includes error handling to catch and display specific errors that may occur during the scan process or when connecting to the OpenVAS Manager.

Command-line Arguments: The script uses the argparse module to handle command-line arguments, allowing users to specify the OpenVAS Manager credentials, target host, and scan configuration ID.

Customizable Scan: Users can provide the OpenVAS Manager host, port, username, and password as command-line arguments, providing flexibility to use different OpenVAS instances.

Usage:
Run the script from the terminal with the desired options:

python openvas_scanner.py openvas_host openvas_port openvas_username openvas_password target_host config_id

Replace openvas_host, openvas_port, openvas_username, and openvas_password with your OpenVAS Manager credentials. Replace target_host with the IP address or hostname of the target to scan. Replace config_id with a valid OpenVAS scan configuration ID.
